# InterviewPrepEngine

InterviewPrep is a lightweight SwiftUI app that serves a rotating set of interview questions across ML, statistics, SWE, and quant topics.

The app does not generate questions. It selects from a structured JSON question bank and tracks progress by category.

Purpose

This project was built as a low-friction, non-intrusive way to:

- Stay sharp on technical fundamentals  
- Practice interview-style thinking  
- Identify weaker subject areas  
- Keep important concepts fresh throughout the day  

It’s intentionally simple — something you can briefly open between tasks without disrupting workflow.

Features

- Randomized question selection from a curated question bank  
- Progress tracking by category (ML, statistics, SWE, quant)  
- Configurable daily question counts  
- JSON-driven structure that makes the question bank easy to extend  

Stack

- SwiftUI  
- Local JSON data store
