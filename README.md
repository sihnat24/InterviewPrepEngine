# InterviewPrep

A lightweight SwiftUI app that serves a rotating set of interview questions
across ML, statistics, SWE, and quant topics.

The app does not generate questions — it selects from a structured JSON
question bank and tracks progress by category.

## Purpose

Designed as a low-friction, non-intrusive tool to:

- Stay sharp on technical fundamentals
- Practice interview-style thinking
- Track weak areas by category
- Keep concepts fresh throughout the day

It’s intentionally simple and lightweight — something you can toggle open
briefly between tasks.

## Features

- Randomized question selection from a curated question bank
- Category-based tracking (ML, statistics, SWE, quant)
- Daily configurable question counts
- JSON-driven architecture (easy to extend)

## Stack

- SwiftUI
- Local JSON data store
- Simple state management
